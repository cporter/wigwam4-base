Wigwam Version Number Policy:

This policy applies to wigwam versions 3.2 or greater. 

wigwam versions are of the form: x.y.z[.b]

x = the major version number:

    major changes, including philosophy changes,
    upgrades across major versions can require changes
    to the project, and other manual intervention
    to publish the upgrade. 

y = the minor version number:

    a minor version change means new features, or re-factoring.
    it will not require any changes to the project. However
    special instructions may be required to publish  the
    upgrade, such as an upgrade to an intermediate version, 
    or a fresh publish.

z = the patch level:

    bug fixes only.
    no project changes will be required to upgrade across a 
    patch level, and no special actions should be required 
    to publish the upgrade. 

    this may be ommited, if the number is zero.   ie 3.1 or 4.2

b = the development / beta versions,

    changes here may be new features, or bug fixes targeted
    for the next patch level, or minor release.
