BASE unpack: guess patch flags, use patch flags canonicalized

fix packages that use provides files with unconstrained versions,
  because default "any" is going to default "provides package version"

packagectl uninstall completion should only look at installed packages

look for .local package-archives in wigwam-bootstrap

optionaldep

load_config_order uses underbars, not dashes

.local's not working with environment config-order (configurable_glob?)

store etc/project-packages in canonical order to prevent meaningless changes

figure out solaris /bin/sh unset dump core problem

archive type bootstrapping (sortof done wrt url type bootstrapping)

packagectl: automatically see if ext/etc/installed-packages is stale wrt 
etc/project-packages, and if so, run update-packages

"two phase " update-packages strategy doesn't work in all situations;
  therefore, fix with single call to planner

hostname -f sh-macros

move -I and -L make options for build/install to front, in case package
adds other libs prior

have wigwam-bootstrap (not from cvs) installed wigwam-base version X

autogen.sh.d -> standard hooks for autogen.sh

get-installed-version

ignore A conflicts B when A provides B

client-side archive load-balancing

move autogen.sh out-of-the-way to prevent errors due to it's being replaced
while being interpreted, similar as wigwam-bootstrap

BUG: package-supplied installed-files not being ignored

dirs file for packages: directories that are created before installation

assume shell-script if not executable in configurable_run

wigwam-base post-install needs way to "restart" the package installation 
process, cuz package pipeline might have changed and still executing old
script

--quiet flag to wigwam-bootstrap to skip anthropomorphic stuff

rebuilding of packages when overrides change (?) ... maybe a pubtool issue

etc/unsanitized, if it exists, should get dot-dist treatment nicer would
be 3-way merge

doesn't find patches in non-version specific package override directory

have reinstall call download first, just in case

BUG: packagectl seems to find packages that don't exist in any archive, then
later finds out they can't be downloaded ... wtf?

TODO: have BASE/download interpret urls file to allow full local packaging
