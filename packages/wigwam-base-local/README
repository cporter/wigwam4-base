wigwam-base is intended to be a 'make' style package,
but the pre-build script here is for invoking automake,
so that stuff not usually checked into CVS when developing
(e.g. configure) is generated.

so, to support this, various files are generated with .local 
extension in autogen.sh ... these shouldn't be checked into CVS
(of course), but also, shouldn't be shipped with wigwam-base 
when packaged for wigwam.
